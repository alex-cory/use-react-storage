let deprecationMessage = `
react-hooks-testing-library has moved to @testing-library/react-hooks!

To upgrade, run:

  npm uninstall react-hooks-testing-library
  npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react-hooks

Remember to also update your import lines to the new package too:

\x1b[31m  - import { renderHook, act } from 'react-hooks-testing-library'
\x1b[32m  + import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks'

Alternatively, you can continue to use an older version of react-hooks-testing-library.

More details on the move can be found here: https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library/issues/99
